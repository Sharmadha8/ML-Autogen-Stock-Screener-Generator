      "4. FnO Previous Day Total Call Volume (Comparing with the previous day's call volume can help identify sudden increase in bullish sentiment) - `FnO Previous Day Total Call Volume > y_prev` where y_prev is the previous day's threshold value for call volume.\n",
      "5. FnO PCR Put to call Volume ratio (A low PCR indicates bullish sentiment, as call volume outweighs put volume) - `FnO PCR Put to call Volume ratio < 1`\n",
      "6. FnO PCR Put to call Volume ratio previous day (Comparing with the previous day's PCR can help identify changes in sentiment) - `FnO PCR Put to call Volume ratio_prev > 1 AND FnO PCR Put to call Volume ratio < 0.8` where 1 and 0.8 are predefined threshold values for low and high sentiment.\n",
      "7. FnO PCR Volume change % (Indicates the percentage change in the PCR, a positive value suggests a decrease in fear or bearish sentiment) - `FnO PCR Volume change % > z` where z is a predefined threshold value indicating significant volume change.\n",
      "8. FnO Total Put Volume change % (Indicates the percentage change in total put volume, a negative value suggests a decrease in fear or bearish sentiment) - `FnO Total Put Volume change % < -w` where w is a predefined threshold value for a significant decrease in put volume.\n",
      "9. FnO Total Call Volume change % (Indicates the percentage change in total call volume, a positive value suggests an increase in bullish sentiment) - `FnO Total Call Volume change % > v` where v is a predefined threshold value for a significant increase in call volume.\n",
      "10. FnO Total Open Interest (High open interest indicates liquidity and active trading in the options market) - `FnO Total Open Interest > q` where q is a predefined threshold value indicating low open interest.\n",
      "11. FnO Previous Day Total Open Interest (Comparing with the previous day's open interest can help identify sudden changes in liquidity or activity) - `FnO Previous Day Total Open Interest < q_prev` where q_prev is the previous day's threshold value for open interest.\n",

      "16. FnO Total Open Interest change % (Indicates the percentage change in total open interest, a positive value suggests an increase in activity or liquidity) - `FnO Total Open Interest change % > u` where u is a predefined threshold value for a significant increase in open interest.\n",
      "17. FnO Total Put Open Interest change % (Indicates the percentage change in put open interest, a negative value suggests a decrease in fear or bearish sentiment) - `FnO Total Put Open Interest change % < -x` where x is a predefined threshold value for a significant decrease in put open interest.\n",

FnO Total Call Open Interest change % (Indicates the percentage change in call open interest, a positive value suggests an increase in bullish sentiment) - `FnO Total Call Open Interest change % > y` where y is a predefined threshold value for a significant increase in call open interest.\n",
      "19. Annualized Volatility (High volatility may indicate increased market risk and uncertainty but can also signal potential opportunity for higher returns) - `Annualized Volatility > v` where v is a predefined threshold value indicating low volatility.\n",
      "20. FnO Marketwide position limit (A high marketwide position limit indicates significant investments in a single stock, which may suggest bullish sentiment) - `FnO Marketwide Position Limit > w` where w is a predefined threshold value indicating low marketwide position limit.\n",
      "21. FnO Marketwide Position Limit % (Comparing the current marketwide position limit with the previous day's limit can help identify changes in investor confidence or positioning) - `FnO Marketwide Position Limit % > z_prev AND FnO Marketwide Position Limit % < 1.5` where z_prev is the previous day's threshold value for marketwide position limit %.\n",
      "22. Rollover (A low rollover cost may indicate a bullish sentiment, as it suggests that investors are not looking to exit their positions) - `FnO Rollover Cost < Rollover Cost Threshold` where Rollover Cost Threshold is a predefined threshold value for a low rollover cost.\n",
      "23. FnO Rollover Cost % (Comparing the current rollover cost with the previous day's cost can help identify changes in investor sentiment) - `FnO Rollover Cost % < -x` where x is a predefined threshold value for a significant decrease in rollover cost %.\n",
      "24. FnO Rollover % change (Indicates the percentage change in rollover, a positive value suggests a decrease in rollover, which may indicate bullish sentiment) - `FnO Rollover % change > y` where y is a predefined threshold value for a significant decrease in rollover %.\n",

Additionally, factors such as rollover cost and change in these factors help to further reinforce the bullish sentiment. These parameters provide a comprehensive set of indicators for finding potentially profitable investment opportunities in options markets.\n",
